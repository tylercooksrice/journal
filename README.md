## Features

### Overview
* A pie chart to show task completion status
* Quick check-list for tasks that are due today so users can mark them off within one click
* Displays upcoming tasks within 7 days from now

### Calendar
* A quick calendar view to show tasks that are due at a specific day of the month
* Hover / click on each cell for a more informative view of the tasks on that day

### Kanban / Task List
* 4 built-in columns (`PLANNED`, `ONGOING`, `COMPLETED`, `ABANDONED`) with capability to remove / add custom columns
* Users can drag-and-drop tasks around columns to quickly change their statuses
* Users can add task under a column to create a task and quickly assign its status

### Journal
* A file-explorer based view for users to elegantly organize journals (files) and folders
* Each journal file has its title, tags, and content editable
* The content is rendered as markdown, with side-by-side toggleable live-preview
* The journal editor auto saves the content based on user action, with 0.5 seconds delay to prevent spamming save operation

### Offline Capacity
* Uses ServiceWorker to cache styles, vendor scripts, and HTML files so once user accessed the website, they will no longer require internet
* Progressive-Web-Application (PWA) built in
